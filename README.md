<h1 align="center">Transformify</h1>

A powerful roblox plugin that allows you to change classes of already created instances easily, fast and correctly.

_Disclaimer: This repository only includes script files. Releases also include any additional instances such as UI._

## Installation ‚öôÔ∏è

You can either download the plugin from [Roblox]() or our [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/StinkUniverse69/Transformify/releases).

## Useage

Simply select the instances you want to transform and then press the _Transformify (Instance Converter)_ Button in the Plugins tab.

## Features ‚ú®

**Convert any Instance into any other**

üöÄ **Blazingly Fast:** Even converting large instance volumes will be done quickly.

üîß **Smooth Conversion:** Any properties that allow it, will be automatically transfered without needing to do anything else. In some cases this will still lead to poor results, so we added some manual overwrites that make the conversion experience even smoother.

üè∑Ô∏è **Automatic Tags & Attributes:** Keeps tags and attributes that were on the instance before.

‚Ü©Ô∏è **Easily Reversable:** Uses the _ChangeHistoryService_ to make conversions reversable.

üß© **Keeps Ordering:** Will not change the order of ui elements

üõ°Ô∏è **Safety Prioritized:** Errors are caught and safely handled, as much as possible of the conversion will still be performed

üîÑ **Automatic API updates**: Uses Roblox Client Checker to keep up to date with the latest Roblox API changes.


### Manual Overwrites
Not all instances are automatically be converted into any other as expected, due to the way Roblox is written.

For this reason _Transformify_ implements a variety of manual overwrites to cover these cases.

| **From** | **To**  | **Effect**   |
|---|---|---|
| MeshPart | MeshPart| Will open a new window where you can either input a _MeshId_, an _AssetId_ or select a MeshPart/Model from your inventory directly. _MeshId_ the _MeshPart.Size_ will not be reset, unlike normally.
| Part | MeshPart | Sets the correct _MeshId_ depending on the _ShapeType_ or if there is a _SpecialMesh_ parented to it and corrects the _Size_ among other things. Also inserts a _SurfaceAppearance_ if needed.
| MeshPart | Part | Tries to guess the _ShapeType_ of the Mesh, if it fails a _SpecialMesh_ is parented. Also takes _SurfaceAppearances_ into account.
|Decal|Texture| Sets the _StudsPerTileU_ and _StudsPerTileV_ so that it looks the same before.
|Attachment|Part or MeshPart| Corrects the _CFrame_ to the _Attachment.WorldCFrame_ and welds it to the parent.
|Part or MeshPart|Attachment| Sets the _WorldCFrame_ to the Part's.
|Decal|MeshPart| Calculates the correct angles for any **Brick Part** and adds _MeshPart_ planes with the decal as surface appearance using the _AlphaMode:Transparency_
|LocalScript|Script|Sets the _RunContext_ to Client
|Decal or Texture|SurfaceAppearance| Sets the _ColorMap_ to the _Texture_ of the previous.

## Permissions ‚ö†Ô∏è

#### Http Permission "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/"
Roblox does not allow plugin developers to access reflection classes easily, that is what classes have what Properties and such. This is why _Transformify_ uses the [Roblox Client Tracker](https://github.com/MaximumADHD/Roblox-Client-Tracker) to get this information. It does this by reading [Roblox-Client-Tracker/roblox/Mini-API-Dump.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaximumADHD/Roblox-Client-Tracker/roblox/Mini-API-Dump.json)

An API dump is also included, so you can disable this permission with minimal effect. But it will not be updated as frequently as the Roblox Client Tracker, so you wouldn't always have the newest available classes.

---

#### Http Permission "https://inventory.roproxy.com/"

This is only required if you want _Transformify_ to suggest MeshParts and Models you've uploaded when transforming a MeshPart into another. Alternatively you can also just open the toolbox and copy a mesh/asset id manually.

Note: You need to have your inventory set to publicly visible for this to work.

---

#### Http Permission "https://assetdelivery.roproxy.com/"
Can be used instead of game:GetObjects() to retrive mesh ids from Models but isn't in use as long as it exists.

---

#### Script Injection Permission
Will be required if you transform a Script or Localscript. Maybe also if you transform something that has a script in it.
